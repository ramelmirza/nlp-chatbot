REPORT FILE:

Same as the first assignment, there isn't any special @mentions or private message functionality. You can just type the message normally. However, in terms of actual functionality with what the bot does; Question 1, 9, and 16 give a special thing in the discord/shell version (I don't want to say it here because it will spoil it but I did label the questions that give it the special thing). I just didn't include Q9 and Q16 in the shell version completely because it doesn't make sense to open a file through python shell - I would have made a tkinter GUI for that, but not enough time.

In terms of spaCy linguistic knowledge, Utterances like:

    "What are your thoughts on Canada"

The user will receive a response back to a link regarding that information.

The crypto_chatbot.py script is for the shell version of the chatbot.
The discord_interface.py script is for the discord version of the chatbot.

        ANSWER: Yes and no. The best analogy I can give is similar to 10 people in a room placing a $20 bill on the table, everyone walking out, then mixing the bills. You know other people have it, and you can see it, but you don't know who it belongs to.
